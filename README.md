# AMR Silver Data for Ensemble Distillation

This repository contains details and instructions for accessing a high-quality silver dataset for Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsing, consisting of 362,000 sentence-AMR pairs. The dataset is created through an ensemble distillation process, combining multiple AMR parsers to produce reliable AMR annotations for robust model training.

## About the Dataset
The silver dataset was generated using the Maximum Bayes Smatch Ensemble Distillation (MBSE) technique, which leverages outputs from different pre-trained AMR parsers. The dataset aims to provide extensive linguistic diversity and varied sentence structures, contributing to the development of advanced AMR parsing models.

### Key Features
- **362,000 Sentence-AMR Pairs**: Making it one of the largest silver datasets for AMR parsing.
- **Enhanced Model Performance**: The increased size of the training corpus has shown a positive impact on the performance of the student model, resulting in higher Smatch scores.
- **Diverse Annotations**: Uses multiple models with different seed releases for a comprehensive set of AMR graphs.

## Maximum Bayes Smatch Ensemble Distillation (MBSE)
The **MBSE** method is a Smatch-based ensembling technique that generates high-quality AMR annotations by combining the outputs of multiple teacher models. This ensemble output is used as distillation knowledge for training a student model.

### Methodology
- **Trained Parsers**:  
  We employed three instances of the **AMR3-structbart-Large** model, each trained on the gold-labeled **AMR 3.0** dataset with different seed releases from IBM Research. This model leverages action sequences, which produce more accurate AMR graphs with reduced noise.
- **Parsing Unlabeled Text**:  
  The trained parsers were used to annotate unlabelled English text, resulting in diverse samples of AMR parses.
- **Smatch-Based Ensemble Algorithms**:  
  Multiple Smatch-based algorithms, including **Graphene-Smatch**, **Greedy-Select**, and **Average-Smatch**, were tested to integrate outputs from the parsers. **Average-Smatch** was selected for its simplicity and competitive performance.

## Download the Dataset
